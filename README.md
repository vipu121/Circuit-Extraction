This project uses the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model for circuit diagram extraction from electronic datasheets. The model is trained to identify and detect circuit components and symbols from images of datasheets, enabling automated processing of circuit diagrams.
Yolo Dataset is used for training purposes
best.pt is the best parameter for CNN(Yolo)
ncs2, pdf2 and page_119 are for testing the model
